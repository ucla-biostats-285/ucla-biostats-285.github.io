## Course Description

This 4-unit course covers recent developments in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) literature with an emphasis on the challenges associated with both big data and high-dimensional statistical models.  The course starts with a quick review of the theoretical foundations of MCMC, Metropolis-Hastings and the Gibbs sampler.  Next, we cover Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.  The course then pivots to surrogate proposal methods and stochastic gradient MCMC and finishes by reviewing recent advances in non-reversible MCMC.
